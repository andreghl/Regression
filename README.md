The aim of this project is to create a regression function algorithm in different programming languages.

**Languages:**

- ```R```

The algorithm will run a regression model involving one independent variable and one dependent variable. The output will be made to ressemble the output of the ```lm()``` function present in the language.

- ```Julia```

The regression algorithm made in Julia will use *Ordinary Least Squares* to solve for the coefficients of any model.
