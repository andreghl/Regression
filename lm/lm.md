# A Linear Regression

The linear regression is one of the most fundamental technique used in Econometrics. Regressions aim to predict the value of a continuous dependent variable based on a series of regressors.

## Introduction

Econometric modeling attempts to estimate the relationship between a set of independent variables or **features**, denoted by $X = (X_{1}, X_{2}, \dots, X_{p})$, and a **response** variable $y$. The parameters $\beta_{p}$ limit the set of possible relationships to those that are linear. The econometrician chooses the features to include and the hypothesized functional form of the model for either inference or prediction purposes.

## Simple Linear Regression

A simple linear regression model has the following form:

$$
y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{i} + u_{i}
$$

where $\beta_{0}$ is the intercept of the model, $\beta_{1}$ shows the average change in the independent variable associated with a one unit change in the value of the regressor, and the error is represented by $u_{i}$.
